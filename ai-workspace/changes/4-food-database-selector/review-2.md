## Blocking Items (B1-B10) — Re-check of Previously Failed Items

| Item | Status | File:Line | Details |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | ------- |
| B3 | **PASS** | `app/components/diet-plan/CustomFoodModal.vue:108` | Added toast error feedback in `handleSubmit` catch block: `toast?.add({ title: message, color: "error" })` |
| B6 | **PASS** | `app/components/diet-plan/FoodSelector.vue:72-74` | Added `AbortController` for in-flight search requests. `onUnmounted` now aborts controller. |
| B10 | **PASS** | `app/components/diet-plan/FoodSelector.vue:198-215` | Dropdown items now use `<button role="option">` with proper ARIA attributes (`aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`). Added keyboard navigation (ArrowUp/Down, Enter, Escape) in `handleDropdownKeydown`. |
| B10 | **PASS** | `app/components/diet-plan/CustomFoodModal.vue:142-175` | Added focus trap in `onMounted`: tracks first/last focusable elements, handles Tab/Shift+Tab cycling, restores body scroll on unmount. |

## Non-Blocking Items (N1-N7) — Logged as Issues

| Item | Issue | File:Line | Details |
| ---- | ----- | --------- | ------- |
| N1 | #TBD | `app/stores/foodItem.ts` | Dual caching (in-memory Map + IndexedDB via useFoodCache) — consider unifying. |
| N2 | #TBD | `app/stores/foodItem.ts:95` | `supabase.auth.getUser()` called on every `createCustomFood` — could cache user ID. |
| N4 | #TBD | `app/utils/foodMacros.ts` | JSDoc present but could add `@example` for `calculateMacros`. |
| N5 | #TBD | `app/components/diet-plan/FoodSelector.vue` | `handleSearch` debounce logic similar to `useDebounce` in `useFoodCache` — could reuse. |
| N7 | #TBD | `app/components/diet-plan/FoodSelector.vue` | Component ~360 lines — consider splitting dropdown into `FoodSearchDropdown.vue`. |
