## Workflows Verified

### 1. Mentee: Toggle Consumed (Check Off Food Item) — BUG-001 + BUG-005

**Status:** PASS

**Steps:**
1. Login as mentee → /diet-plan → verify plan loads (Breakfast: Milk whole 500g/305cal; Lunch: items)
2. Click checkbox on "Milk, whole" → toggle ON
3. Verify DB: `diet_plan_logs` row created (`consumed = t`, `consumed_at` set)
4. Click checkbox again → toggle OFF
5. Verify DB: same row **updated** (`consumed = f`, `consumed_at = NULL`), no duplicate row

**Before Fix:** Toggle ON threw `ERROR: Could not find the 'macros' column of 'diet_plan_logs'`; Toggle OFF threw `duplicate key value violates unique constraint`.

**After Fix:** Both toggle ON and toggle OFF work end-to-end.

### 2. Coach: Navigate to Edit Page — BUG-006 + BUG-007 + BUG-008

**Status:** PASS

**Steps:**
1. Login as coach → /coach/diet-plans → verify mentee list with plans
2. Click "Edit" on a plan OR navigate directly to `/coach/diet-plans/:id/edit`
3. Verify edit page loads with plan data pre-populated

**Results:** Edit page loads with:
- Plan name: "Edit Workflow Test"
- Start Date: 2026-11-04, End Date: 2026-11-08
- Breakfast: Chicken breast, raw (100g, 165 cal, 31g protein)
- Page stays on edit page (no immediate redirect)

**Before Fix:** Edit page immediately redirected back to `/coach/diet-plans` with "Plan updated successfully" toast (auto-save watch fired on initial load).

**After Fix:** Edit page loads and stays loaded with plan data.

## Fixes Applied

| Bug | File | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|------|------------|-----|
| BUG-001 | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:348` | `toggleConsumed` upserts `macros` into `diet_plan_logs` — column doesn't exist | Removed `macros` from upsert payload |
| BUG-001b | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:281` | `fetchLogs` selects `macros` — column doesn't exist | Removed `macros` from select |
| BUG-001c | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:44` | `DietPlanLog` declares `macros?` — mismatches schema | Removed from interface |
| BUG-005 | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts` | Upsert lacks `onConflict`, toggle-off creates duplicate | Added `{ onConflict: "mentee_id, food_item_id, log_date" }` |
| BUG-006 | `app/utils/supabase.ts:15` | `getSupabase(true)` reads missing `authStore.user.access_token` | Added `accessToken` to authStore, used in `getSupabase(true)` |
| BUG-007 | `app/pages/coach/diet-plans/[id]/edit.vue` | Auto-save watch fires after data load, redirects immediately | Removed auto-save watch |
| BUG-008 | `app/pages/coach/diet-plans/[id]/edit.vue` | No `loading.value = false` in failure path; redirects to `/` | Added `try/catch/finally`, redirect to list |
