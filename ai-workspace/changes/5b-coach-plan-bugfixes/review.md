## Round History

### Round 1

| Item | Status | File:Line | Details |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | ------- |
| B1 | PASS | — | Names clear: `toggleConsumed`, `fetchLogs`, `DietPlanLog` |
| B2 | PASS | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:39-44` | `DietPlanLog` has explicit typed fields, no `macros`; no `any` introduced |
| B3 | PASS | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:331-356` | `toggleConsumed` try/catch + throws error; `fetchLogs` try/catch + console.error |
| B4 | PASS | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:273-276` | `fetchLogs` early-returns setting `this.logs = {}` when no food items |
| B5 | PASS | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:349-355` | Store manages own `this.logs` state; no argument mutation |
| B6 | PASS | — | No subscriptions/timers/listeners in these functions |
| B7 | PASS | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts` | Follows existing store pattern (try/catch + console.error + store state) |
| B8 | PASS | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:336` | Removed unused `item` variable (was causing lint `no-unused-vars`) |
| B9 | PASS | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:335-344` | Parameterized Supabase queries; no string interpolation/injection |
| B10 | PASS | — | Store-only fix; no UI changes needed |

**Round 1: APPROVED** — All 10 blocking items PASS.

### Round 2 (post-QA additional fixes)

During verify-qa, additional bugs were found and fixed:

| Item | Status | File:Line | Details |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | ------- |
| BUG-005 | FIXED | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts:344` | Added `{ onConflict: "mentee_id, food_item_id, log_date" }` to upsert — toggle-off now updates existing row instead of duplicate insert error |
| BUG-006 | FIXED | `app/stores/auth.ts:23,40,61` + `app/utils/supabase.ts:15` | Added `accessToken` to authStore, populated from `supabase.auth.getSession()`, `getSupabase(true)` now uses it — RLS queries succeed in browser |
| BUG-007 | FIXED | `app/pages/coach/diet-plans/[id]/edit.vue` | Removed auto-save `watch` that fired after initial plan data population, causing immediate redirect |
| BUG-008 | FIXED | `app/pages/coach/diet-plans/[id]/edit.vue` | Added `finally` block with `loading.value = false`; redirect to `/coach/diet-plans` on profile failure |

**Round 2: APPROVED** — All additional fixes verified via QA.

## Non-Blocking Items (N1-N7) — Logged as Issues

| Item | Issue # | File:Line | Details |
| ---- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| N4 | — | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts` | Store actions lack JSDoc comments — consistent with rest of store (none have JSDoc). Logged as future docs cleanup. |
| N5 | — | `app/stores/dietPlan.ts` | `fetchLogs` and `toggleConsumed` both touch `diet_plan_logs` but with different operations — not worth extracting a helper yet. |

---

## Decision

**Round 2: APPROVED** — All blocking items pass, all additional fixes verified.

---

## Summary

- **Blocking:** 10 pass (Round 1) + 4 additional fixes (Round 2), 0 fail
- **Non-blocking:** 2 logged (N4 docs, N5 DRY)
- **Acceptance criteria:** MET — all 4 criteria verified:
  1. ✅ Mentee checks off item → `diet_plan_logs` row saved
  2. ✅ Coach creates plan with unique date → save succeeds (unique constraint works)
  3. ✅ Coach navigates to Edit page → loads plan data, stays on page
  4. ✅ Error toasts display on save failures

## Files Reviewed

### Modified Files

1. **`app/stores/dietPlan.ts`** — Removed `macros` from 3 locations; added `onConflict` to upsert
2. **`app/stores/auth.ts`** — Added `accessToken` state, populated from session, cleared on logout
3. **`app/utils/supabase.ts`** — `getSupabase(true)` uses `authStore.accessToken`
4. **`app/pages/coach/diet-plans/[id]/edit.vue`** — Removed auto-save watch; added `definePageMeta`, `try/catch/finally`

### New Files

1. **`tests/unit/dietPlanStore.test.ts`** — 5 new unit tests for `toggleConsumed` and `fetchLogs`
